# rest-api

A Polymer element providing declarative data bindings to REST API.

## Example

```html
<link rel="import" href="/bower_components/rest-api/rest-api.html">
<link rel="import" href="/bower_components/rest-api/rest-api-resource.html">

<rest-api url="http://localhost:3000">
  <rest-api-resource name="books" collection="{{books}}"></rest-api-resource>
</rest-api>
```

## Documentation and Live Demo

See [API documentation](https://platosha.github.io/rest-api/components/rest-api/).

Check the [Albums Demo](http://platosha.github.io/rest-api/components/rest-api/demo/index.html), the fully declarative albums browser which uses [JSON Placeholder API](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

## Install

This element is distributed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can install
Bower it with npm:

    npm install -g bower

Then use Bower to install `rest-api`:

    bower install rest-api

After running the command above, you should get `bower_components` directory
in your project, containing `rest-api` and the dependencies.

## Development Instructions

### Dependencies

Element dependencies are managed with Bower. Use this command to install the
required dependencies:

    bower install

### Running the Development Server

`<rest-api>` needs a REST API (sic) to work with. This repository includes a
very handy development server configuration with integrated backend, based on
[BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) and
[JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). Just install npm
dependencies:

    npm install

Then you can run the server with:

    npm start

Once running, your browser should automatically navigate to the element's page.
By default, it is served from `http://localhost:3000/components/rest-api/`. Now
that you have a backend, the [JSON Server Demo](http://localhost:3000/compontents/rest-api/demo/json-server.html)
should work.

You can also browse the API at `http://localhost:3000/api/`. The mock data is
generated automatically and stored in db.json file. To regenerate the API data,
delete the db.json file and start the server again.

Press `Crtl+C` to stop the development server when it is not needed.

### Running Tests

Navigate to the `/test` directory of the element to run its tests, e.g.:
`http://localhost:3000/components/rest-api/test/`

The tests are done with the [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester).
